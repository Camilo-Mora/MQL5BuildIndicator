# About {-}

Lets create a simple indicator that will plot the two lines of the Bollinger bands. And create a third variable to display 1 if the price is above the upper band, and 2 if it is below the lower band.

[File](images/BB_Bands.mq5) 

```{r, out.width = "150%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/BB.png")
```

## Open the MQL5 editor {-}

  
1. Open the Meta editor
```{r, out.width = "150%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/IDE.png")
```


## Create templete {-}

2. Click on New (Red arrow)

3. Click on Custom Indicator (Blue arrow)


```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/MQL5Editr.png")
```

4. Name the indicator and click accept on all other settings.

As a result, the editor will return the based template of an indicator. You can delete all lines of code in grey, and those up the top... they are not necessary and make the editor to crowded

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/BaseIndicator.png")
```

## Basic templete {-}

At the end you should have the basic sections of the indicator:
```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Templete.png")
```

# Indicator sections: {-}
Most commonly an indicator includes the following sections:

**Global variables**

**OnInit {}**

**OnCalculate{}**

Each section should contain specific lines of code, which will check next.


# Global variables {-}

  
These are the variables that you put up the very top of the script. By them being global it means they will be available in all sections of the indicator. 

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Glnal1.png")
```

This section can include:


## Other indicators needed {-}

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Include.png")
```



## Plot properties {-}

### Where to place the indicator {-}

In which chart will the indicator be plotted

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Global.png")
```

### How many lines to plot {-}
In the case of the BB we need two Arrays (orBuffers) to store the data for the upper and lower bands. Here you can also indicate that the indicator will use 2 lines.

"indicator_buffers" should indicate the number of arrays to use. Think of it like number of data containers that the indicator needs.

"indicator_plots" should indicate the number of plots to draw in the chart.

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nLines.png")
```


### Plot attributures {-}

In this section you need to define things like whether the indicator will deploy a line, its color, and the name of the line. In the case of the BB, we need two lines. Each line also need to have a unique name, because later if we want to delete them, we need to call them by their name to remove them.



All other attributes of the indictor are self explanatory. Each attribute of the indicator needs to be reference by the number at the end... like "indicator_color2" will indicate the color of the second line. "indicator_color1" the color of the first line.

```{r, out.width = "150%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Plot.png")
```


## Inputs {-}

The variables that the user can modify in the user interface. 

The name of the field that appears in the form (ser interface) is shown after the //.

In our case, the user can modify three variables: the length of the BB, how many bars to shift the results, and the number of standard deviations to use. 

```{r, out.width = "150%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Inputs.png")
```

## Handle and buffers {-}
In the Global section of the indicator you also need to define the handle. Which will be the numeric name used by the indicator. 
In this section you also will need to create the buffers where the data will be stored... as mentioned earlier, we will use two buffers...here we define who are they.
```{r, out.width = "150%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/HandleBuffer.png")
```

## Containers for other variables {-}
In this section we should also define any other variable we want to use everywhere. In our case we need a holder to define long of short, a buffer to store that data, and a holder for the Close price.

```{r, out.width = "150%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/OtherVars.png")
```



# OnInit{} {-}

## Handle {-}
in this section you need to define the function of the indicator to a handle. Basically we tell MQL5 what equation we will use. In this part, you can insert the inputs defined by the user earlier.

```{r, out.width = "150%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Handle.png")
```
## Map buffers {-}

Define the numeric values that will be given to the different buffers. This is call "Mapping buffers", basically once all is done, MQL5 will return the values of the buffers in the order mentioned here. In the case of BB, the upper buffer will be given 0 and the lower buffer 1. If at any later case you need to use the values of the upper band, you need to call the indicator and its buffer 0, if you want the values of the lower band, you will call the indicator and its buffer 1.

```{r, out.width = "150%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/MapBuffers.png")
```

# OnCalculate{} {-}

This is where the hardcore calculations are done. In this section you can include things like:

## Bypass {-}
Baypass bars for which there is not enough data. Say you ask to calculate the BB over the last 20 bars but thee are only 10 bars, in which case the claculaiton will by pass until there are at least 20 bars.

```{r, out.width = "150%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ByPass.png")
```

## Optimize calculations {-}
Tell MT5 to run calculations from the start if this is the first time rning the code. however, if the code is already running calculate only for the last bar. This section can be coded in many different ways, and it is important that you check the outputs of the indicator. Specifically if the Buffer is being used from right to left or from left to right. By default the array is read from left to right. The latest value is in the latest cell.

```{r, out.width = "150%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/nBars.png")
```

## Copy buffers {-}
Move data from the indicator handle to the respective buffer. In the case of the BB indicators, it delivers 3 buffers (0: mean lines, 1: pper and 2:lower). but we in this case we only want the upper and lower buffer, so we copy buffer 1 from the indicator into our upper buffer, and bufer 2 of the indicator into our lower buffer.

```{r, out.width = "150%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/CopyBuffers.png")
```
## Additional calculations {-}

One can also do additional calculations over the desire range of candles.


```{r, out.width = "150%", echo= FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Calculations.png")
```
